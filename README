Localizer
=========

Localizer is meant to abstract the management of localized attribute values in models.

Suppose you have a blog application with a model called Post, with a title and a content. Each Post will need to support at least two languages - possibly more in the future.
All you need to do in this case is declare the localized attributes in your model this way:

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
        localize :title, :content
    end

Localizer will automatically generate methods such as get_title() and set_title() and it will manage the storing of the localized strings in the database.
You could then call @post.get_title(I18n.locale) in your views and it would
return the title of the post according to the locale of the user.


Generator
=========
Localizer needs a table to be created in the application's database. Run
    $ script/generate localizer
and a migration will be automatically created.


API
===
Localizer will generate the following methods for the model.
- set_<attribute>(value, locale)
- get_<attribute>(locale, fallback)
- <attribute>s=(values)
- <attribute>s
- update_localized_attribute_<attribute>(params)
- with_local_<attribute>(locale)
- validates_default_locale(attributes)

See the section on the API Example for a more thorough explanation.


API Example
===========
    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
        localize :title, :content
    end

This will generate the following methods:
- set_title(title, locale)
    To set the value of the attribute for a specific locale.
    If a locale is not specified, I18n.default_locale is used.
    Ex: @post.set_title("Hello!", "en")
- get_title(locale, fallback)
    To get the value of the attribute for a specific locale.
    If a locale is not specified, I18n.default_locale is used.
    Ex: @post.get_title("en") # Will return "Hello!"
    When the fallback parameter is true, the method will return the value
    for I18n.default_locale when the value for the specified locale is empty.
    Ex: @post.get_title("it", true) # Will return "Hello!" since there's no value for "it".
- titles=(titles)
    To set all the localized strings in one go.
    The parameter is a hash of locale => string.
    Ex: @post.titles = {"en" => "Hello", "it" => "Ciao"}
- titles
    To get all the localized strings in one go.
    The return value is a hash of locale => string.
    Ex: @post.titles # Will return {"en" => "Hello", "it" => "Ciao"}
- update_localized_attribute_title(params)
    This method replaces the update_attributes() method for the localized
    attribute. The parameter is the same hash as in the update_attributes()
    method.
    This method should be called BEFORE update_attributes(), since it will
    remove from the params hash the reference to :titles, which will make
    the standard method choke.

It will also install a named scope:
- with_local_title(locale)
    This scope may be useful to avoid hitting the database with many calls
    to retrieve the localized strings. It will basically load all of them in
    one fell swoop.
    For example:
    @post.with_local_title.all(:conditions => {...})
    will load all the instances of Model and take care to load all the
    localized strings for the specified locale too. If a locale is not
    specified (as in the example), I18n.locale will be used.

A method for validation is provided:
- validates_default_locale(attributes)
    It will make sure a value has been provided for the locale corresponding
    to I18n.default_locale, for all the specified attributes.
    For example:
    validates_default_locale :title, :content
    will make sure a title and a content have been inserted at least for the
    "en" locale

In addition, it will generate two methods to access the inner workings of the
plugin. They shouldn't be needed in most situations, though.
- localized_titles=(localized_strings)
    To set all the localized strings by actually passing an array of
    LocalizedString instances.
    Ex: @post.localized_titles = [LocalizedString.new(...)]
- localized_titles
    To get all the instances of LocalizedString connected to the model.
    Ex: @post.localized_titles
